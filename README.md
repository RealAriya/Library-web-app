# Library-application
In this app, we aimed to create a library membership system in the simplest way possible using Flask.
With the help of XAMPP and MySQL, we stored the data using three methods: adding a new member, editing member information, and deleting members. 
 
To better understand database connectivity through this method, please refer to the "SqlAlchemy" documentation.
